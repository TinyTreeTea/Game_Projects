For counless days and nights,
Never turned off the lights,
Never woke with an alarm,
Till we hear the toll of drum,
Till we shatter from within,
And strech our skill soo thin,
Till we collapse,
Shall not relax,
And our journy is achieved,

++Company proudly presents,
our official gaming project github repository.
